# First coding assignment! - Credit card issuer checking

## Description
Given a credit card number we can determine who the issuer/vendor is with a few basic knowns.

Complete the function getIssuer() that will use the values shown below to determine the card issuer for a given card number. If the number cannot be matched then the function should return the string Unknown.

| Card Type  | Begins With          | Number Length |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| AMEX       | 34 or 37             | 15            |
| Discover   | 6011                 | 16            |
| Mastercard | 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55 | 16            |
| VISA       | 4                    | 13 or 16      |

## Examples
```
getIssuer(4111111111111111) == "VISA"
getIssuer(4111111111111) == "VISA"
getIssuer(4012888888881881) == "VISA"
getIssuer(378282246310005) == "AMEX"
getIssuer(6011111111111117) == "Discover"
getIssuer(5105105105105100) == "Mastercard"
getIssuer(5105105105105106) == "Mastercard"
getIssuer(9111111111111111) == "Unknown"
```

# Second coding assignment
The problem:
Having created a function NamedOne which takes first & last names as parameters and returns an object with firstName, lastName and fullName ( = firstName + a space + lastName ) properties which should be all accessibles, we discovered that "accessible" also means "mutable".

If, for example, we've got a "NamedOne" like this :

```
var namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")
namedOne.firstName // -> "Naomi"
namedOne.lastName  // -> "Wang"
namedOne.fullName  // -> "Naomi Wang"
```

...properties may be changed :

```
namedOne.firstName = "John"
namedOne.firstName // -> "John"
namedOne.lastName = "Doe"
namedOne.lastName  // -> "Doe"
```
...but all properties are not updated !

```
namedOne.fullName  // -> "Naomi Wang" 
//-- Oh no ! we want fullName == "John Doe" now !
```

Your mission:
So the purpose of this kata is to create an object with accessible and "updatable" (can i say that?) properties.

If .firstName or .lastName are changed, then .fullName should also be changed
If .fullName is changed, then .firstName and .lastName should also be changed.
Note : "input format" to .fullName will be firstName + space+ lastName. If given fullName isn't valid then no property is changed.

Examples:
```
var namedOne = new NamedOne("Naomi","Wang")

namedOne.firstName = "John"
namedOne.lastName = "Doe"
// ...then...
namedOne.fullName // -> "John Doe"

// -- And :
namedOne.fullName = "Bill Smith"
// ...then...
namedOne.firstName // -> "Bill"
namedOne.lastName  // -> "Smith"

// -- But :
namedOne.fullName = "Tom" // -> no : lastName missing
namedOne.fullName = "TomDonnovan" // -> no : no space between first & last names
namedOne.fullName // -> "Bill Smith" (unchanged)
```
Can you change our function to create such a NamedOne object ?

(Hint: in this kata you'll try to define properties of an object )
